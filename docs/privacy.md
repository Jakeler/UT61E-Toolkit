## UT61E Toolkit / Privacy Policy
The app does not collect any personal information. Period.

What happens on your phone stays on your phone. Multimeter measurements are stored only on your local storage.

But I am only a random stranger from the internet, you don't have to trust me. Instead see the open source (Apache License 2.0) code and compile it yourself: https://github.com/Jakeler/UT61E-Toolkit
